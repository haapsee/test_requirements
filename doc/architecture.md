# Software Architecture: "Hello, World!" Web Application

This document outlines the software architecture for a simple web application designed to display a "Hello, World!" message with specific styling and a visual effect.

## 1. High-Level Overview

The system is a minimal, single-page web application. It consists of static HTML and CSS files served by a lightweight web server. Users access the application through a standard web browser, which requests and renders these static assets. There is no backend logic, database, or complex dynamic content involved.

```

## 2. Architectural Components

Given the simplicity of the requirements, the architecture comprises two primary logical components: the Frontend (Static Web Assets) and the Web Server.

### 2.1. Frontend (Static Web Assets)

This component encompasses all client-side files that are directly served to and rendered by the user's web browser.

*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Display the core "Hello, World!" text content.
    *   Apply the specified "blueish dark gray" color to the text.
    *   Apply the specified "light blueish gray" background color to the page.
    *   Apply a blur effect to the designated element containing the "Hello, World!" text.
    *   Ensure cross-browser compatibility for styling and effects.

*   **Technologies Used:**
    *   **HTML5:** For structuring the web page content (e.g., `index.html`).
    *   **CSS3:** For styling the page elements, including colors, background, and the `filter: blur()` effect (e.g., `style.css`).

*   **Key Files & Structure:**
    *   `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the "Hello, World!" text, likely within a heading tag (e.g., `<h1>`). It will link to `style.css`.
        *   Example Snippet:
            ```html
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html lang="en">
            <head>
                <meta charset="UTF-8">
                <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
                <title>Hello App</title>
                <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
            </head>
            <body>
                <h1 id="hello-message">Hello, World!</h1>
            </body>
            </html>
            ```
    *   `style.css`: The CSS file containing the styling rules.
        *   Example Snippet:
            ```css
            body {
                background-color: #ecf0f1; /* Light bluish gray */
                display: flex;
                justify-content: center;
                align-items: center;
                min-height: 100vh;
                margin: 0;
                font-family: sans-serif;
            }

            #hello-message {
                color: #34495e; /* Blueish dark gray */
                filter: blur(5px); /* Apply blur effect */
            }
            ```

### 2.2. Web Server

This component is responsible for serving the static frontend assets to client browsers upon request.

*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Listen for incoming HTTP requests on a designated port (e.g., 80 or 8080).
    *   Serve the `index.html` file as the default page for the root URL (`/`).
    *   Serve the `style.css` file when requested.
    *   Correctly set HTTP headers, including `Content-Type` (e.g., `text/html` for HTML, `text/css` for CSS).

*   **Technologies Used:**
    *   **Nginx:** A high-performance web server commonly used for serving static content due to its efficiency and robust configuration options. It's suitable for production environments.
    *   **Alternative (for local development/simplicity):**
        *   **Node.js with `http-server` package:** A lightweight, zero-configuration command-line http server.
        *   **Python's `http.server` module:** A very basic built-in HTTP server for quick local testing.

*   **Configuration (Example for Nginx):**
    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name localhost; # Or your domain name

        root /usr/share/nginx/html; # Directory where index.html and style.css are located
        index index.html;

        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }

        # Optional: Add specific caching for static files
        location ~* \.(css|js|gif|jpe?g|png)$ {
            expires 1d;
            add_header Cache-Control "public, no-transform";
        }
    }
    ```

## 3. Data Flow

1.  A user opens their web browser and navigates to the application's URL (e.g., `http://localhost/` or `http://your-domain.com/`).
2.  The browser sends an HTTP GET request for the root path (`/`) to the Web Server.
3.  The Web Server receives the request, identifies that the root path corresponds to `index.html`, and serves the `index.html` file to the browser.
4.  As the browser parses `index.html`, it encounters the `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` tag.
5.  The browser sends another HTTP GET request to the Web Server for `style.css`.
6.  The Web Server serves the `style.css` file to the browser.
7.  The browser applies the CSS rules from `style.css` to the `index.html` content, rendering the "Hello, World!" text with the specified colors and blur effect on the "light bluish gray" background.

## 4. Deployment Considerations

*   **Containerization:** The application can be easily containerized using Docker. A simple `Dockerfile` can be created to build an Nginx image that serves the static files.
*   **Hosting:**
    *   **Cloud Static Hosting:** Services like AWS S3 with CloudFront, Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages are ideal for hosting such a static site.
    *   **Virtual Private Server (VPS):** A VPS can be used to install Nginx and serve the files.
*   **Version Control:** All source code (HTML, CSS, server configurations if applicable) should be managed in a Git repository.
