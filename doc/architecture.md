# Software Architecture Document: Hello World Web Application

## 1. High-Level Overview

This document outlines the software architecture for a simple web application designed to display a "Hello, World!" message with specific styling. The application follows a classic client-server model, where a web server serves static HTML and CSS files to a web browser. There is no complex backend logic or database interaction required for the current scope.

The primary goal is to provide a foundational web presence that is easily accessible and visually compliant with specified design requirements.

## 3. Main Components

### 3.1. Frontend

*   **Description**: The client-side component responsible for rendering the user interface and displaying the "Hello, World!" message. It consists of standard web technologies (HTML and CSS) served directly to the browser.
*   **Responsibilities**:
    *   Display the text "Hello, World!".
    *   Render the page with a "light blueish gray" background.
    *   Render the "Hello, World!" text in "blueish dark gray".
    *   Ensure cross-browser compatibility for basic rendering and styling.
*   **Technologies Used**:
    *   **HTML5**: For structuring the content (`index.html`).
    *   **CSS3**: For styling the page and text (`style.css`).
*   **Key Files/Artifacts**:
    *   `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the "Hello, World!" text.
    *   `style.css`: An external CSS file defining the visual styles for the page.
*   **Styling Details**:
    *   **Text Color ("blueish dark gray")**: `#36454F` (Charcoal)
    *   **Background Color ("light blueish gray")**: `#D3DBE2` (Light Slate Gray)

### 3.2. Backend (Web Server)

*   **Description**: A minimal server component responsible for receiving HTTP requests from clients and serving the static frontend assets (HTML and CSS files). It does not involve any application-specific business logic or data processing beyond file serving.
*   **Responsibilities**:
    *   Listen for incoming HTTP requests on a specified port (e.g., 8080).
    *   Serve `index.html` as the default page for the root URL (`/`).
    *   Serve `style.css` when requested by the browser.
    *   Ensure proper MIME types are sent with responses (e.g., `text/html` for HTML, `text/css` for CSS).
*   **Technologies Used**:
    *   **Node.js**: As the runtime environment for the server.
    *   **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework used for simplifying static file serving and routing.
*   **Key Files/Artifacts**:
    *   `server.js` (or `app.js`): The main server script responsible for setting up the Express app and serving static files.
    *   `package.json`: For managing Node.js dependencies (e.g., Express).

### 3.3. Database

*   **Description**: A database component is **not required** for the current scope of displaying a static "Hello, World!" page.
*   **Responsibilities**: N/A
*   **Technologies Used**: N/A

## 4. Data Flow

1.  **User Request**: A user opens a web browser and navigates to the application's URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/`).
2.  **HTTP Request to Server**: The web browser sends an HTTP GET request for the root path (`/`) to the Web Server.
3.  **Server Processes Request**: The Web Server (Node.js with Express) receives the request. It is configured to serve `index.html` as the default file for the root path from a designated static assets directory.
4.  **HTML Response**: The Web Server sends the `index.html` file back to the browser.
5.  **Browser Parses HTML**: The browser receives `index.html`, parses it, and identifies a link to `style.css` in the `<head>` section.
6.  **CSS Request**: The browser sends a new HTTP GET request to the Web Server for `style.css`.
7.  **Server Serves CSS**: The Web Server serves the `style.css` file.
8.  **Browser Applies CSS & Renders**: The browser receives `style.css`, applies the defined styles (text color, background color) to the HTML content, and renders the complete "Hello, World!" page on the user's screen.

## 5. Deployment Considerations

Given the simplicity of the application, deployment options are straightforward:

*   **Static Site Hosting**: The `index.html` and `style.css` files can be directly hosted on any static file hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages) or a basic web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) configured to serve these files.
*   **Node.js Server Deployment**: The Node.js application (`server.js`) can be deployed to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS EC2, Google Cloud Run) that supports Node.js applications.
*   **Containerization**: For consistency across different environments, the Node.js server can be containerized using Docker. This would involve creating a `Dockerfile` to package the application and its dependencies.

## 6. Future Considerations

While not required for the current scope, this architecture provides a minimal foundation for future expansion:

*   **Dynamic Content**: Introduce server-side rendering or API endpoints if dynamic content or user interactions are needed.
*   **Database Integration**: If persistent data storage is required (e.g., user profiles, content management), a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) could be integrated with the backend.
*   **Complex Frontend Frameworks**: For more interactive and complex user interfaces, a JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) could be introduced on the frontend, communicating with the backend via RESTful APIs.
*   **Scalability**: For higher traffic, the Node.js server could be scaled horizontally (multiple instances behind a load balancer).
